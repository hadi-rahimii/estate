## This is a project created with next.js

### I started this project to make  progress in the next.js area

### Here, I didn't use all the features of next.js, but it was used as much as possible to define next.js!!

### This project is about real estate sales, which helps us to buy houses and villas and takes less time from us
### I hope I was able to help you
